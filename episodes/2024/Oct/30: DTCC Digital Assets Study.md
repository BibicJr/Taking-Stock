Today on Taking Stock we'll be discussing the recent DTCC study on Digital Assets effects on Collateral Management. Per @john.xlm , DTCC Digital Assets is their Securrency acquisition. One of the primary benefits to digital assets is how it can enable direct custodial control for participants and transparency for onlookers - DTCC as umbrella for the centralized security depository for US markets will have an interesting sponsored take on this tech. The report was authored by Nadine Chakar, an industry veteran who is currently the Global Head of DTCC Digital Assets. Her prior roles included acting as Securrency CEO, an RWA tokenization firm, before they were acquired by DTCC and as the head of State Street Digital, which was a focused division of the State Street asset management firm.
