I've scheduled Ankit as a guest on Monday 10-21 at 9pm EST, to accomodate his schedule. Ankit has described his project as an effort to bridge the gap of understanding between disparate sections of retail involved in the financial sector, and during the show we'll talk more about his personal history and the specific goals he has, and the routes he sees to accomplish them.
